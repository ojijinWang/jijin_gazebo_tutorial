Parameters:
~<name>/global_frame (string, default: "/map")
	The global frame for the costmap to operate in. 
~<name>/robot_base_frame (string, default: "base_link")
	The name of the frame for the base link of the robot. 
~<name>/transform_tolerance (double, default: 0.2)
	Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot. 
~<name>/update_frequency (double, default: 5.0)
	The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated. 
~<name>/publish_frequency (double, default: 0.0)
	The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information. 
~<name>/rolling_window (bool, default: false)
	Whether or not to use a rolling window version of the costmap. If the static_map parameter is set to true, this parameter must be set to false. 
~<name>/always_send_full_costmap (bool, default: false)
	If true the full costmap is published to "~<name>/grid" every update. If false only the part of the costmap that has changed is published on the "~<name>/grid_updates" topic. 
~<name>/width (int, default: 10)
	The width of the map in meters. 
~<name>/height (int, default: 10)
	The height of the map in meters. 
~<name>/resolution (double, default: 0.05)
	The resolution of the map in meters/cell. 
~<name>/origin_x (double, default: 0.0)
	The x origin of the map in the global frame in meters. 
~<name>/origin_y (double, default: 0.0)
	The y origin of the map in the global frame in meters.
